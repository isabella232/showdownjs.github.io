Within a subparser, the events always follow a certain order (sequence). For instance, .before events always run before .captureStart . Each subparser raises several events sequentially: .start : always runs except it subparser is disabled Raised when the subparser has started , but no capturing or any modification to the text was done. Always runs (except if the subparser is deactivated through options). Properties : property type access description input string read The full text that was passed to the subparser output string write The full text with modification that will be passed along the chain regexp null matches null Usually you would want to use this event if you wish to change the input to the subparser .captureStart : might not be run ; Raised when a regex match is found and a capture was successful. Some normalization and modification of the regex captured groups might be performed. Might not be run if no regex match is found. Properties : property type access description input string read The captured text output string write The text that will be passed to the subparser/other listeners regexp RegExp readonly Regular Expression used to capture groups matches object read/write Matches groups. Changes to this object are reflected in the output Usually you would want to use this event if you wish to modify a certain subparser behavior. Exs: remove all title attributes from links; change indentation of code blocks; etc... .captureEnd : might not be run ; Raised after the modifications to the captured text are done but before the replacement is introduced in the document.
